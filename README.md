# minimal_path

## Plan

### Components needed

1. Triangle parser - Gets the lines with the values and builds the proper structure from it checking all the requirements to be a proper triangle
2. Input reader - read the input from standard input
3. Minimal path calculator - executes the algorithm
4. Ways of displaying the triangle and the output path

## Run application

```shell
sbt run

And then provide the file name, e.g.:
input
```

## Run tests

```shell
sbt test
```
