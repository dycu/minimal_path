# Assumptions

## Reading the input

Aa I'm working on Windows and had problems with passing console input to "sbt run"
I've chosen to allow the user to enter the file name on which he/she wants to perform
the algorithm.

## Minimal value in case of equal values

I assumed that on the triangle row neighbouring nodes can have the same values. In that
case the algorithm defaults to the left.
